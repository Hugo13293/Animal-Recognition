# Animal_Recognition_TF

A basic python project developed in PyCharm to experiment around with the basics of Tensorboard, ImageNet pretrained models and ConvNets. The dataset used is the animal faces dataset provided by this link https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10#OIP---lAIbDlHKmejDpqrXq6vAAAAA.jpeg

### Prerequisites

Python virtual enviornment with Tensorflow and Python Image Library (Pillow). If this project expands to PyTorch, then the use of DataLoaders will provide for PIL.

## Notes - This is a P.O.C, not an end project

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/)
* [PIL - Python Image Library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Future Notes

* End goal is to test exporting to TF.slim for deployement on an Android Studio project. Will link to Android project if completed.
